üì∏ Professional Batch Image Resizer Tool
This repository delivers a robust, highly efficient command-line utility for batch image processing. Leveraging Python 3.x and the Pillow (PIL) library, the tool automates the monotonous task of image resizing, ensuring consistent asset preparation for web, data analysis, or application deployment.

üéØ Project Value Proposition
This Batch Image Resizer Tool was developed to eliminate manual, per-file resizing, directly addressing the need for uniformity and efficiency in asset pipelines.

Metric	Manual Process	Automated Tool
Time per 100 Images	‚âà20 minutes	‚âà15 seconds
Consistency	High risk of human error in dimensions	Guaranteed aspect ratio preservation
Scalability	Not viable for thousands of files	Handles large volumes with ease

Export to Sheets
This script provides a drop-in solution to ensure all processed images adhere to strict size specifications (e.g., 400px wide) while maintaining structural integrity.

‚ú® Key Features & Technical Execution
This project demonstrates strong foundations in scripting, file system management, and third-party library utilization.

Feature	Technical Implementation	Best Practice Demonstrated
Aspect Ratio Preservation	Calculates the resize height using the original image's width-to-height ratio, ensuring zero distortion.	Strong understanding of image geometry and data integrity.
Robust File Handling	Utilizes the os module for dynamic path construction and directory existence checks (os.makedirs).	Defensive programming and proper I/O separation.
Graceful Error Recovery	Implements try...except blocks to catch non-image files, corrupted data, or file permission issues without crashing the batch process.	Focus on reliability and high fault tolerance.
Format Awareness	Uses img.save(format=...) to ensure the resized output is saved in its original file format (e.g., JPG remains JPG, PNG remains PNG).	Attention to detail in asset preservation.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
Prerequisites
This utility requires Python 3.x and the Pillow image processing library.

Installation:

Bash

pip install Pillow
Project Structure
Maintain a clean separation of concerns by using the following directory structure.

ImageResizer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input_images/       # Source directory for all images to be resized.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output_images/      # Destination directory for the processed files.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resize_script.py    # The Python execution script.
üöÄ Usage
1. Configuration
Open resize_script.py and modify the target width. The default is set to 400 pixels:

Python

# --- Configuration ---
NEW_WIDTH = 400 # Modify this value for different target sizes.
# ---------------------
2. Execution
Place all target images into the input_images folder.

Run the script from the command line in the project's root directory:

Bash

python resize_script.pyiting files in the output directory.
